# Credit card fraud detection with Logistic Regression 

Credit card fraud detection is a huge problem in the finance and banking industry, with billions of dollars lost each year. In addition, this is a classic example in the field of imbalanced learning as fraudulent transactions take up an extremely small fraction of all transactions. 

The data set being used is "Credit Card Fraud Detection",  found on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

The goal of this project is to practice exploratory data analysis (EDA), and then using Logistic Regression to solve this classification problem.
